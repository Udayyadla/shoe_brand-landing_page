# Show Brand Landing Page - React.js Challenge

This project is the result of completing Challenge 1 in the React Challenges series. The task was to develop a landing page for a show brand using React.js, based on a design provided in a Figma file. Here's a summary of the development process:

## Development Process

   - Reviewed the Figma file provided for the landing page design.
   - Analyzed the layout, components, colors, and typography used in the design.

2. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized a new React.js project using `create vite@latest`

3. **Integration with Figma Design**
   - Ensured that the landing page closely matches the design provided in the Figma file.

## Repository Structure

- `/src`: Contains the source code for the React application.
- `/public`: Contains images, icons, or other static assets used in the project.

## Instructions for Running Locally
